The objective is to build a simple application that connects to a Google Drive folder, accesses various documents, and uses an AI model to summarize their content. The requirements include integrating with Google using OAuth2, accessing a specific folder, listing and downloading documents (including PDFs, DOCXs, and TXTs), extracting text from each document, and summarizing the content using OpenAI GPT or another summarization model. The output should include the file name and a short summary of 5-10 sentences. The application will display results on a simple web interface or console output and allow for downloadable CSV or PDF reports. Additionally, the summaries will be displayed in a styled HTML table with file links. The deliverables include a GitHub repository link with setup steps and code that includes Google Drive integration, document parsing logic, AI summarization, and output rendering (web/console)."

The Doctor's Appointment System is a web-based application designed to automate and optimize the process of booking and managing medical appointments. The system aims to reduce manual errors, improve doctor-patient communication, and ensure centralized data management with a responsive and user-friendly interface. The project was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and follows a three-tier architecture: presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. The system includes various modules such as patient registration and login, doctor search and appointment booking, and administrator management. Strong security mechanisms are implemented to protect user information and maintain confidentiality, including secure user authentication and authorization, encrypted storage of sensitive patient data, role-based access control (RBAC), and secure data transmission.

The project aims to provide an efficient, secure, and scalable platform for managing medical appointments, reducing administrative overhead, eliminating scheduling conflicts, improving data accuracy, and enhancing patient satisfaction. The system was tested for errors and performance before deployment on a server for real-time use."

The paper presents a smart surveillance system, called SAAR, which uses YOLO-based object detection to identify potential threats in real-time from CCTV video feeds or mobile-captured images. The system detects weapons, suspicious behaviors, and masked faces with an average accuracy of 80%. It also includes motion detection, anomaly recognition, and real-time notification mechanisms to proactively alert security personnel to emerging threats. The system operates in both edge and cloud environments and supports static and video input. The authors fine-tune a YOLOv8 model on a curated dataset of weapons and hazardous objects to recognize the presence of weapons and interpret intentionality in weapon use through pose-weapon interactions. The system detects threats, such as guns, knives, fire, and explosions, and classifies them into high or medium threat levels based on their intent and severity. The authors also propose an algorithm for threat detection and alerting, which includes steps such as initializing the system, analyzing the video stream, detecting weapons and poses, and triggering alerts for potential threats."
